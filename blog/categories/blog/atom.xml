    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was recently asked to recommend a computer for the older generation. So I thought to myself, “what would this older generation want to have in its computers?” &ndash; So I asked my mother. She noticed many things that she desires for her computer to have. For instance, she is jealous that I can talk into my phone’s microphone to ask Google “What’s the weather?” She would like to hear her laptop answer her questions. She’s getting older, she just wants the answers. She’s frustrated by typing. She wants a more user friendly computer that she can bond with. She wants a virtual personal assistant that would connect to banking finances to pay bills without hassle. Unfortunately, the technology isn’t to that level of interconnectivity with voice yet.</p>

<p>Portable computers called “chromebooks” offer Google voice search. Each chromebook has a microphone built-in. So I recommended the current Amazon best-selling chromebook, the Acer C720, to my mother. It’s easily portable, has long battery life, and most-of-all has active voice search functionality. With this chromebook, she would have the capability to ask questions to Google and receive responses like I do on my Nexus 5. It would be an interactive and personable experience. My mother already uses Google Drive’s suite of office tools with her Google account, so it was a great choice. She’s already familiar with the fundamentals of a cloud based system. The tighter integration between these tools and chromebooks would be icing-on-the-cake.</p>

<p>The older generations seem to want personal computers with features that “just work out-of-the-box.” My mother dreads configuring settings because she doesn’t know nor want to learn about the inner-workings of programs that run in the background. The chromebook is the answer to this predicament. Chromebooks are minimal-effort machines that work right out-of-the-box. There is no device on the market today with features built-in that would serve my aging mother better than a chromebook would.</p>
